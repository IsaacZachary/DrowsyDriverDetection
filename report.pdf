# Drowsy Driver Detection System - Project Report

## 1. Introduction
Drowsy driving is a significant cause of road accidents. This project aims to develop a **Drowsy Driver Detection System** that can classify a driver's state as **Alert, Microsleep, or Yawning** in real-time using deep learning.

## 2. Dataset
The system is trained using the **Frame Level Driver Drowsiness Detection (FL3D)** dataset.
- **Source:** [FL3D Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matjazmuc/frame-level-driver-drowsiness-detection-fl3d)
- **Total Images:** 53,331
- **Categories:**
  - **Alert** (Driver is attentive)
  - **Microsleep** (Short period of sleep)
  - **Yawning** (Indicates fatigue)
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Image resizing
  - Normalization
  - Data augmentation

## 3. Model Architecture
The model is built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with the following layers:
- **Convolutional Layers** (Feature extraction)
- **Batch Normalization** (Improves stability)
- **Dropout Layers** (Prevents overfitting)
- **Fully Connected Layers** (Classification)
- **Activation Function:** Softmax for multi-class classification

## 4. Training & Evaluation
### 4.1 Training
The dataset is split into **Training (80%)** and **Validation (20%)** sets. The model is trained using:
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Metrics:** Accuracy
- **Epochs:** 50
- **Batch Size:** 32

### 4.2 Evaluation
- **Accuracy:** Achieved an accuracy of 92% on validation set.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Shows classification performance across classes.
- **Precision & Recall:** Measured to balance false positives and false negatives.

## 5. Real-Time Detection
A real-time detection system is implemented using OpenCV.
- **Webcam Feed:** Captures frames
- **Face Detection:** Identifies driver’s face
- **Classification:** Predicts driver’s state and displays result
- **Alert Mechanism:** Triggers an alarm if drowsiness is detected

## 6. Results & Findings
- The model effectively detects drowsy states in real-time.
- It performs well under controlled lighting conditions but struggles with extreme low-light environments.
- Improvements can be made by incorporating infrared cameras for nighttime detection.

## 7. Conclusion
The Drowsy Driver Detection System provides an effective solution for preventing accidents caused by driver fatigue. Future enhancements include:
- Integrating an **audio warning system**
- Enhancing the dataset with **more diverse driving conditions**
- Deploying the model in **embedded systems** for real-world usage.
